This code is intended to simulate XLive libaries over System Link for Halo 2 Vista.

Currently, I have my repo set up differently to Permanulled/Cartographer. All the latest stable additions will be added from my peers to the above repo as it is the cartographer repository that is the most complete and feature rich from cartographer to cartographer release. Use that as a starting ground rather than the repos that my peers own.

My current repos are as it stands: ShadowTeddy/cartographer/development - Always up-to-date fork of Permanulled/Cartographer ShadowTeddy/cartographer/Single-Player - Cartographer repository focused on fixing the single player aspect of Halo 2 Vista VIA Project Cartographer ShadowTeddy/cartographer/H2X-rebalance - Cartograpehr repo focused on rebalancing halo 2's weapon scheme to fit that of original Halo 2. This will essentially make Halo 2 Vista a perfect recreation of original Halo 2 (complete with updated textures and framerate, at-least I hope.)

I will be making new repos whenever I wish to add in extra features for the sake of consistency and documentation (rather than just updating ShadowTeddy/Cartographer/development)

To get the project to compile into a .dll, you will need a few things:

Basic knowledge of Visual Studio. If you cant manage this, look back now.

Directx SDK (June 2010)

The project should compile on the latest commit if you have the library paths correctly set up (google this if unsure).
